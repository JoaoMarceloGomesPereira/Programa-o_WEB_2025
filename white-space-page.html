            <h1>Understanding White Space</h1>
                <p>The (br) tag is used to break lines<br>
                And the tag &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; jump spaces that<br>
                can't be put back together, if dont use them<br>
                In the html language the normal spaces are readed like just one<br>
                Like that      i jump 5 spaces but just count as one<br>
                But if a i do the same spaces using "nbsp" tag the output is different<br>
                Here is a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; example</p>
